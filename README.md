JS Error Insight

JS Error Insight is a beginner-friendly web tool that helps
students understand JavaScript errors in a simple way.

While learning JavaScript, I faced difficulty understanding
error messages like ReferenceError and SyntaxError.
So I created this project to explain errors in easy language
and also provide a corrected code example.

- Detects common JavaScript errors
- Shows error type and message
- Explains the error in simple words
- Provides corrected code example
- Clean and simple user interface

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

How to Use:
1. Paste JavaScript code into the textarea
2. Click on "Check My Code"
3. View error explanation or success message

Current Limitation:
- This tool supports JavaScript only

Purpose:
This project is created for learning and practice purpose
as part of my B.Tech coursework.
